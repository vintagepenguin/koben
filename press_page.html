              <h2><strong>What is Køben?</strong> </h2>
            </header>

            <p>Denim has gone from the workingman's staple to fashion piece to a luxury item. There are tons of variations of denim with fit, finish, color and treatments that have innovated the way that we wear our denim and how it looks. The denim sector has grown pretty steadily year over year with a trend towards more 'luxury' versions in the market.</p>

            <!-- <br> -->

            <p>While the improvements to denim have been primarily focused on the finish or the exterior, very little has been done to increase the comfort of the wearer with a garment that many would say has some comfort issues. With the advent of stretch fabrics, denim has become less restrictive and better conforming to bodies but still there are innovations that can be done to make denim awesome.</p>

            <!-- <br> -->

            <p>Enter Køben silk-lined jeans. It seemed like a good idea to bring real innovation to denim by incorporating a lining fabric that is seriously comfortable but also functional. The construction of our jeans allows the fabrics to work together instead of feeling like a traditional liner that twists and separates from the garment. With the temperature regulating and wicking properties of silk coupled with durable denim, we feel like we have come up with a real winner.</p>

              <h2><strong>The History</strong> </h2>
            </header>
            <p>The idea for lining jeans with silk came while I was living in Hong Kong and at the time it seemed like a relatively simple concept. Little did I know that a 'simple' sewing operation would turn into hours upon hours of work and two years of development to get to where I felt like what I had in mind had become an actual product.</p>
            <!-- <br> -->
            <p>I started with jeans because I wanted more comfortable, quality clothing that was consistent with my style and denim was pretty uncomfortable for me. Specifically, I wanted to construct jeans that I could wear both professionally and casually but that were incredibly comfortable. Drawing from my design experience at J.Crew, Lands’ End and others, I built on an existing feature used in men's slacks and decided to line jeans with silk. </p>
            <!-- <br> -->
            <p>The first real test for my newly minted silk-lined jeans came while in a plane over the Pacific Ocean when the air-conditioner quit. I woke up in panic, as my upper body was damp with sweat. I quickly realized I was hardly sweating anywhere that was covered with silk. I later found out that it was due to the temperature regulating and moisture-wicking properties of the silk.</p>
            <!-- <br> -->
            <p>After several iterations and design improvements and a full year of wear testing, I created Køben to share the magic. If you love comfort and you think silk inside jeans sounds awesome, help me make Køben a reality.</p>
            <br>

              <h2><strong>The Name</strong> </h2>
            </header>
            <p>While on a trip to Denmark, I met up with some of my relatives and experienced a pretty deep dive into Danish life and how they live. I was fascinated to see how similar my mindset and overall view on life was compared to my relatives. On top of this, I was able to locate where my ancestors lived, their business locations and where they were buried. I had such an enjoyable time consuming Danish design from all aspects, including how my family had affected their surroundings by helping build Carlsberg Beer at its conception. </p>

            <!-- add back when we get the image: (My Ancestor's Beer label below) -->

            <p>As I started turning the silk-lined jeans into a product, it felt like it was a good idea to incorporate my perception of Danish design and culture into the brand. Køben comes from the first half of Copenhagen in Danish - København, the capital of Denmark. </p>
            <p>København loosely means 'Merchants Harbor' with the Køben signifying the merchants. I thought the word sounded cool and I liked the significance, so it seemed like a good fit.</p>

                        <p>There were three different fits that we made for the women's jeans but the one fit that seemed to be the most consistent with what we are trying to accomplish with the jeans.
                          </p>
                          <p>To make it somewhat more suited to the way we saw women wearing their jeans, we had pretty much everybody we knew try them on and wear test them for us. We got a lot of feedback and incorporated much of it in the next iterations of the jeans.</p>

                      <p>We started with a slim fit for the men because we wanted to build jeans that were comfortable but tailored to be useable in professional and casual settings. The fit for these jeans was based on a prototype that we sewed on a 1906 Singer sewing machine. Luckily, we hooked up with a great manufacturer in California to make several prototypes to get to our current fit. </p>

            <h2><strong>Why Kickstarter?</strong> </h2>
          </header>
            <p>
            With several crowd-sourced funding websites that are really building great momentum for Start-ups, we felt we needed to research and contact as many people that are involved in them and companies that have been successful and unsuccessful on the myriad platforms. Kickstarter stood out as the crowd-sourcing platform that has an amazing community of people who love fashion and who are passionate about supporting new products. Although we felt like there were other platforms that have good traffic and a strong community, the Kickstarter community seemed like the best one to help us build our product into a reality.
